# gregbrimble.com
Personal website of Greg Brimble, Technological Engineer & penultimate year student at the University of Edinburgh

## Roadmap
* Extract out components to `gregbrimble-components`
* Move inline styles to stylesheets/components
* Unit testing
* Better CI/CD
* Images
* Toast when updates are ready
* Wrap root element SSR, rather than client (think there's a Gatsby bug here)
* Move data to `gatsby-config.js`
* Google Analytics etc.
* GitHub branch permissions
